# ✨ Features

### **1. Crewmate Cam Access (F2)**
   - **🖥️ Description:** Allows crewmates to access security cameras from anywhere.
   - **👀 Strategic Use:** Monitor other players without needing to go to the security room.

### **2. Necromancer Role**
   - **🔮 Description:** A special Impostor role that can revive a dead player to join the Impostors.
   - **💨 Keybinds:** Press `F4` for teleport ability.

### **3. Revival Royale GameMode** *(currently unavailable)*
   - **⚔️ Description:** Every player is a Necromancer, competing to revive bodies. The first to reach a set number of revivals wins.

### **4. Energy Thief Role**
   - **💡 Description:** Drains energy from others, making them weaker.

### **5. Double Agent Role**
   - **🔍 Description:** Completes tasks but can sabotage neutrals and impostors after task completion.

### **6. Special Agent Role**
   - **🎖️ Description:** A neutral role that assigns missions to other players.
      - **📋 Mission Mechanics:** The assigned player must complete the mission or face penalties.
         - If the target fails the mission, the Special Agent loses a point toward their win condition.
      - **📹 Surveillance Option:** The Special Agent can monitor the target through a camera if enabled.
      - **🏆 Win Condition:** Successful mission completions contribute to the Special Agent’s victory.

### **7. Visionary Role**  
- **📸 Description:** A unique Crewmate role with the ability to take in-game screenshots to capture key moments like kills, venting, or suspicious activities.  
- **🖱️ How It Works:**  
  - The Visionary can take multiple screenshots, but the limit depends on game settings.  
  - If multiple screenshots are taken, the Visionary can open the in-game chat to see available screenshots (e.g., `/1`, `/2`) and select which one to display during a meeting.  
- **🧩 Strategy:** Use screenshots to catch impostors or prove innocence.
